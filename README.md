## Proposed Mission Statement

> _"FTW is establishing a perpetual endowment to fund philanthropic programs that advance moral, economic, cultural, and justice-centered progress.

---

## Historical Context

**Previous Mission:**  
To disburse monthly grants to the current full-time OpenLibra engineering team, funded from donations.

**Previous Administrators:**  
Iqlusion LLC

**Previous Activities:**  

The payment schedule was interrupted in June 2022 and has not resumed. Assets are now held by Infinite Game LLC.

## Historical Disbursements

| Date       | Amount | Recipient               |
|------------|--------|-------------------------|
| 2022-06    | TBD    | OD (Full Time Engineer) |
| 2022-06    | TBD    | Badrock (Full Time Engineer) |


## Proposed changes:**  

Previous owed disbursements to full time engineering team members will be proposed to the beneficiaries.
At the recipients’ discretion, the owed payments may be donated to (retained within) FTW as the initial corpus for investing with the purpose of funding the mission.
The structure will change from a short term grant-making program for OL developement, to a perpetual and external philanthropic mission.
Future donations will form the corpus capital of the perpetual endowment.
Administration and custody for all legal purposes has transferred from Iqlusion LLC to Infinite Game LLC, which were the main beneficiaries of the grant process.

## Proposed Treasury Policy

**Planned Treasury Structure:**  
- After final FTW awards from the original mission are distributed, the remaining funds will form the corpus of a perpetual endowment.

**Reserve/Disbursement Strategy:**  
We aim to implement a lawful and compliant Flywheel Endowment (perpetual income model). As is customary with a perpetual endowment, corpus capital cannot be spent directly but will be reinvested, such that returns can be used to fund future mission operations. In the event there are any residuals from operating income those will be returned to the community in a compliant manner. These are aspiration, the mechanisms, schedule, and participants are yet to be determined, and may change over decades and centuries.
